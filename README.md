# Scratch-Projects
This is a collection of Scratch projects that I have built. I use these to teach students how to use Scratch for building games and animation.
Scratch is a very usefule platform to learn programming works at a very young age. 
Since it is a block-based programming language with a visual interface and because of the easy to navigate buttons and live execution, it becomes very easy to understand how 
algorithms work in a program. From a programming perspective, I think it creates a foundation on how object-oriented programming work at a very conceptual level.
This collection contains 7 projects that I demonstrate in my "Advanced Scratch" class at Fusion Education Center, New York.
